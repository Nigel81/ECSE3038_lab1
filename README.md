<Question 1:
   The function takes a maximum of 3 resistor values and sum the reciprocal of all the values. The total sum of the reciprocated values is then reciprocated again. This is the parallel resistance value, in line with the formula 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. The parallel resistance value is then printed to the terminal correct to 3 decimal places.

   **_Purpose:_**
   This code was written to find the value of 3 resistors in parallel.

<Question 2:
   The function takes a voltage and any length resistor list and calculate voltage across each resistor. 
   The function first calculates the total resistance in series using a for loop. Then the current through the circuit is found by dividing the voltage by the total current. After that is done, a next for loop is use to find the voltage across each resistor in the list and print it to the terminal. 

   **_Purpose:_**
   To find the voltage across each resistor given any amount of resistors in series.

<Question 3:
   The function takes a patient's temperature and a symbol with indicates whether it's Celcius or Fahrenheit. In the function, the symbol is tested. If it is a "C", it only goes to the section of code dealing with celcius. If it is "F", it only goes to the section of code that deals with Fahrenheit. In both Celcius and Fahrenheit sections, the temperature is tested by a if, if else and else statement. When a statement is true, the correct corresponding message is printed on the terminal concerning the patient's temperature.

   **_purpose:_**
   To check the temperature of a patient and output a status on the patient's temperature whether the temperature is in Celcius or Fahrenheit
