Question 1:
   The function takes a maximum of 3 resistor values and sum the reciprocal of all the values. The total sum of the reciprocated values is then reciprocated again. This is the parallel resistance value, in line with the formula 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. The parallel resistance value is then printed to the terminal correct to 3 decimal places.

   Purpose:
   This code was written to find the value of 3 resistors in parallel.
